An exploration of modeling aleatoric uncertainty using variational inference techniques to improve model performance on churn rate data.

Abstract:
Baysian neural networks (BNNs) are powerful tools that augment traditional neural
networksâ€™ powerful inference abilities with the power to describe uncertainties. BNNs have led
to advances in various areas including computer vision and health.. In most BNNs, only
epistemic uncertainty, uncertainty from the model parameters, is accounted for, but recent
methods have shown that aleatoric uncertainty, uncertainty deriving from the data, can also be
modeled and lead to model improvements. In this paper, we argue for modeling aleatoric
uncertainty in the churn prediction problem. I.e determining whether subscribers of a service will
quit in the near future. We demonstrate results from modeling aleatoric uncertainty with neural
networks on churn data for a telecom company.
